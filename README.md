Value of an array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between pairs of consecutive elements in the array. Formally, for a given array A = {A1, A2, A3, ... , An}, value(A) = |A1 - A2| + |A2 - A3| + |A3 - A4| + ... + |An-1 - An|, where |x| means the absolute value of x.  You will be given an array A of n integers and q updates. Each update will have two integers x and y. For this update, you should replace all the occurrences of element x in the array with y and output the value of the new array.
